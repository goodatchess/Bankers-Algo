# Bankers-Algo
Deadlock Detection Engine Using Banker’s Algorithm | C++, basic GUI (Tkinter/CLI), and Git .
• Designed and implemented a Deadlock Detection System using a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) and
Banker’s Algorithm to simulate and prevent deadlocks in process-resource interactions.
• Developed an interactive CLI/GUI interface for user input of processes, resources, and dynamic
request-allocation state
• Applied cycle detection algorithms (DFS) on the RAG to identify unsafe and deadlocked states in real time
